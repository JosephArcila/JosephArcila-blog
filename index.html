        <p>This project was exciting because I needed to animate an animal of my preference and I am a big fan of nature. I decided to animate an ant because I love them, they have a super organized structure with different roles for different types of ants, they walk in a straight line, they are super strong and there are ants almost everywhere. So I felt really inspired by this project.</p>

        <p>This project was also exciting because in order to make each part of the ant proportional to the rest of the body, I needed to review my knowledge on <a id='khan' href='https://www.khanacademy.org/math/arithmetic/fraction-arithmetic'>fractions</a> here on Khan Academy.

        <p>This project was for reviewing our knowledge on loops, we needed to build our house or other building of our choice. I decided to build the tower of appartments where I live and I used google earth images to make it as similar as possible.</p>
        <p><a class='link' href='https://www.khanacademy.org/computer-programming/villa-calasanz-2-bogot-colombia/6088903779581952' >Villa Calasanz 2 Bogot√° Colombia<br><img src='https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/fe/La_Castellana_kr_49_cl_92_Bogot%C3%A1.JPG/540px-La_Castellana_kr_49_cl_92_Bogot%C3%A1.JPG' width='250' alt='my neighbourhood'></a></p>
        <p>The final result is a beautiful looking tower which looks pretty similar to where I live. that's why I like it so much.</p>
